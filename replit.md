# Amazon Photo Editor

## Overview
A mobile-first AI product photo editor built with Expo React Native. The app captures product photos and uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to automatically remove backgrounds and create Amazon-ready white background product images (2000x2000 JPG).

## Current State
- MVP complete with camera capture, AI background removal, and gallery save functionality
- Express backend with Gemini AI integration for image processing
- Single-screen workflow: Camera → Preview → Generate → Save

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Expo React Native (SDK 54), React Navigation 7
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **AI**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image via Replit AI Integrations (no API key required)
- **Image Processing**: Sharp.js for resizing and white background compliance

## Key Features
1. **Camera Capture**: Uses expo-camera for live preview and photo capture
2. **Image Picker**: Fallback to gallery selection via expo-image-picker
3. **AI Background Removal**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image removes backgrounds and places product on pure white
4. **White Compliance Guard**: Post-processing to ensure pure white background (RGB 255,255,255)
5. **Output Specs**: 2000x2000 JPG, product centered at 85% frame fill
6. **Gallery Save**: Uses expo-media-library to save processed images

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/amazon-main` - Process product photo (multipart form, file field)

## User Preferences
- Android-first design focus
- Material Design 3 inspired UI with purple primary color
- No tabs needed - simple stack navigation
- Minimal UI with focus on the product image

## Recent Changes
- Initial MVP build (January 2026)
- Implemented camera capture with expo-camera
- Added Gemini 2.5 Flash Image integration for background removal
- Created white background compliance guard with Sharp.js
- Added save to gallery functionality with expo-media-library
- Fixed network connectivity issue for Expo Go on Android (January 2026)

## Troubleshooting: Network/Server Connectivity Issues

### Problem: "Network request failed" or "Unable to connect to server" in Expo Go

**Root Cause**: Mobile devices on external networks (cellular or different WiFi) cannot reach non-standard HTTPS ports. Replit exposes services on specific ports:
- Port 5000 (Express API) → External port 5000
- Port 8081 (Metro/Expo) → External port 80 (default HTTPS)

When the mobile app tries to connect to `https://domain:5000/api/...`, many mobile networks block this because port 5000 is non-standard. Only the default HTTPS port (443/80) is reliably accessible from mobile devices.

**Symptoms**:
- API works perfectly when tested from the Replit server (curl localhost:5000)
- API works when tested with port in URL from within Replit
- Mobile app in Expo Go fails with "Network request failed"
- No requests appear in Express server logs from the mobile device

**Solution**: Configure Metro to proxy API requests to Express

1. **Created `metro.config.js`** with a middleware that proxies `/api` requests:
```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require("http-proxy-middleware");

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.server = {
  ...config.server,
  enhanceMiddleware: (middleware) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
      if (req.url.startsWith("/api")) {
        const proxy = createProxyMiddleware({
          target: "http://localhost:5000",
          changeOrigin: true,
          logLevel: "warn",
        });
        return proxy(req, res, next);
      }
      return middleware(req, res, next);
    };
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

2. **Updated `client/lib/query-client.ts`** to strip the port from API URLs:
```typescript
// Always strip port suffix as mobile devices on external networks 
// cannot reach non-standard ports. The API must be accessible on standard HTTPS.
return `https://${url.hostname}/`;  // Not url.host which includes port
```

**How it works**:
- Mobile app requests go to `https://domain/api/amazon-main` (no port)
- Replit routes this to port 8081 (Metro) via the default HTTPS mapping
- Metro's proxy middleware intercepts `/api` requests
- Requests are forwarded to Express on localhost:5000
- Response flows back through Metro to the mobile app

**Key Files**:
- `metro.config.js` - API proxy configuration
- `client/lib/query-client.ts` - API URL construction (strips port)
- `.replit` - Port mappings (port 8081 → external 80)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test API through default HTTPS (should work from mobile)
curl https://your-domain.replit.dev/api/health

# Test API directly on port 5000 (only works internally)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```
